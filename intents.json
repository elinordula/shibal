Once approved by the class in-charge, the request is forwarded to the Head of the Department (HOD) for verification, ensuring it meets college policies. Upon HOD approval, students can collect their gate pass, granting them permission to leave campus during college hours.

After the class in-charge approves the request, it is forwarded to the Head of the Department (HOD), who verifies that the reason adheres to college policies; the HOD's approval is vital for the process to advance. Once verified, students can collect their gate pass, permitting them to exit the campus during college hours. For those residing in hostels, an additional approval from the Hostel Warden is necessary before the standard procedure can be initiated. Furthermore, in certain situations, especially emergencies, the college may contact the student’s parents to ensure they are aware of and approve the request."
